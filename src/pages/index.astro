					Thank you Veronica for listening and getting it right. Now when I go back you ask "the usual?" and I'm like, "please!"

					You're my hair cutter now. I got too many things on my mind to worry about my hair. Thank you for taking care of it for me!.`,

She even lines up my facial hair just the way I like it. Fair prices, excellent customer service and just an overall warm and kind woman. Veronica kicks ass dude! Yeah!`,
